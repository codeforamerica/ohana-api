    Welcome to the Ohana API developer portal!
  %p
    This particular instance of the API exposes information about various organizations in San Mateo County. Most of the organizations provide human services, but the API also includes museums, parks, libraries, hobby clubs, educators, government services, and other types of organizations.
  %p
    If you want to see what the Ohana API can do for your city, visit #{link_to "smc-connect.org", "http://www.smc-connect.org"}, which we built for San Mateo County using the Ohana API. If you want us to bring Ohana API to your city, please #{mail_to "ohanapi@codeforamerica.org", "get in touch"} with us.
  %p
    We want you to build something that will connect underprivileged residents with the help they need (food, shelter, medical care, etc.). Read the #{link_to "documentation", "#{ENV["API_BASE_URL"]}docs"} to learn more.
