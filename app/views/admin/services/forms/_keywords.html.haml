      The best way to ensure a service appears in search results is to write a detailed and accurate service description. If certain words or phrases cannot be part of the description, such as common misspellings, then the keywords field is where you can add them.

  = field_set_tag do
    = text_field_tag 'service[keywords][]', @service.keywords.join(','), id: 'service_keywords', class: 'form-control'
