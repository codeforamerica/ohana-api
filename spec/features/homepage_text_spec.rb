  # The 'login_as' method is a Warden test helper that
  # allows you to simulate a user login without having
  # to fill in the sign in form every time. Since we're
  # not testing the signing in part of the app here, we
  # can take advantage of the Warden helper and speed up
  # our integration tests.

  # All other methods are part of the Capybara DSL
