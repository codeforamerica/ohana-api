# Running Ohana API on your computer

## Install Prerequisites

Before you can run Ohana API, you'll need to have the following software
packages installed on your computer: Git, Ruby 2.1+, RVM, and Postgres.
If you're on a Linux machine, you'll also need Node.js and libpq-dev.

If you already have all of the prerequisites installed, you can go straight
to the [Ohana Installation](#install-ohana-api). Otherwise, there are two ways
you can install the tools:

1. Use our Vagrant [virtual machine][dev-box], which has everything set up for
you. This is the recommended method for Windows users.

[dev-box]: https://github.com/codeforamerica/ohana-api-dev-box

2. Install everything manually: [Build tools][build-tools], [Ruby with RVM][ruby],
[Postgres][postgres], and [Node.js][node] (Linux only).

[build-tools]: https://github.com/codeforamerica/howto/blob/master/Build-Tools.md
[ruby]: https://github.com/codeforamerica/howto/blob/master/Ruby.md
[postgres]: https://github.com/codeforamerica/howto/blob/master/PostgreSQL.md
[node]: https://github.com/codeforamerica/howto/blob/master/Node.js.md

### PostgreSQL Accounts

On Linux, PostgreSQL authentication can be [set to _Trust_](http://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.1/static/auth-methods.html#AUTH-TRUST) [in `pg_hba.conf`](https://wiki.postgresql.org/wiki/Client_Authentication) for ease of installation. Create a user that can create new databases, whose name matches the logged-in user account:

    $ sudo -u postgres createuser --createdb --no-superuser --no-createrole `whoami`

On Mac with Postgres.app, this setup is provided by default.

## Install Ohana API

### Fork and clone

[Fork this repository to your GitHub account][fork].

Clone it on your computer and navigate to the project's directory:

    git clone https://github.com/<your GitHub username>/ohana-api.git && cd ohana-api

[fork]: http://help.github.com/fork-a-repo/

### Set up the environment variables & customizable settings

#### Configure environment variables
Inside the `config` folder, you will find a file named `application.example.yml`.
Copy its contents to a new file called `application.yml`, and read through the documentation.

#### Adjust customizable settings
_This step is only necessary if you are planning on customizing the app with_
_the intent of deploying it. If you just want to submit a pull request, you can_
_use the default `settings.yml`._

Inside the `config` folder, you will also find a file called `settings.yml`.
In that file, there are many settings you can, and should, customize.
Read through the documentation to learn how you can customize the app to suit
your needs.

### Install the dependencies and populate the database with sample data:

    script/bootstrap

_Note: Installation and preparation can take several minutes to complete!_

### Run the app

Start the app locally on port 8080:

    rails s -p 8080

### Verify the app is returning JSON

[http://localhost:8080/api/locations](http://localhost:8080/api/locations)

[http://localhost:8080/api/search?keyword=food](http://localhost:8080/api/search?keyword=food)

We recommend the [JSONView][jsonview] Google Chrome extension for formatting
the JSON response so it is easier to read in the browser.

### Uploading and validating your own data

- [Prepare your data][prepare] in a format compatible with Ohana API.

- Place your CSV files in the `data` folder.

- From the command line, run `script/reset` to reset the database.

- Run `script/import` to import your CSV files.

If your data doesn't already include a taxonomy, and if you want to use the Open
Eligibility taxonomy, you can create the categories with this command:
```
bin/rake create_categories
```

If your Location entries don't already include a latitude and longitude, the
script will geocode them for you, but this can cause the script to fail with
`Geocoder::OverQueryLimitError`. If you get that error, set a sleep time to
slow down the script:
```
script/import 0.2
```

Alternatively, cache requests and/or use a different geocoding service that
allows more requests per second. See the [geocoding configuration][geocode]
section in the Wiki for more details.

If any entries contain invalid data, the script will output the CSV row
containing the error(s):
```
Importing your organizations...
Line 2: Organization name can't be blank.
```

Open the CSV file containing the error, fix it, save it to the `data` folder,
then run `script/import`. Repeat until your data is error-free.

### Export the database

Once your data is clean, it's a good idea to save a copy of it to make it easy
and much faster to import, whether on your local machine, or on Heroku.
Run this command to export the database:

```
script/export_prod_db
```
This will create a filed called `ohana_api_production.dump` in the data folder.
This will also automatically remove all test users and admins before the export.

### Import the database locally

To restore your local database from your clean data:
```
script/restore_prod_db
```

### User and Admin authentication (for the developer portal and admin interface)

To access the developer portal, visit [http://localhost:8080/](http://localhost:8080/).

To access the admin interface, visit [http://localhost:8080/admin/](http://localhost:8080/admin/).

The app automatically sets up users and admins you can sign in with.
Their username and password are stored in [db/seeds.rb][seeds].

[seeds]: https://github.com/codeforamerica/ohana-api/blob/master/db/seeds.rb

The third admin in the seeds file is automatically set as a Super Admin. If you
would like to set additional admins as super admins, you will need to do it
manually for security reasons.

To set an admin as a Super Admin:

    psql ohana_api_development
    UPDATE "admins" SET super_admin = true WHERE email = 'masteradmin@ohanapi.org';
    \q

Replace `masteradmin@ohanapi.org` in the command above with the email of the
admin you want to set as a super admin.
