# Running Ohana API on your computer

## Install Prerequisites

Before you can run Ohana API, you'll need to have the following software
packages installed on your computer: Git, Ruby 2.1+, RVM, and Postgres.
If you're on a Linux machine, you'll also need Node.js and libpq-dev.

If you already have all of the prerequisites installed, you can go straight
to the [Ohana Installation](#install-ohana-api). Otherwise, there are two ways
you can install the tools:

1. Use our Vagrant [virtual machine][dev-box], which has everything set up for
you. This is the recommended method for Windows users.

[dev-box]: https://github.com/codeforamerica/ohana-api-dev-box

2. Install everything manually: [Build tools][build-tools], [Ruby with RVM][ruby],
[Postgres][postgres], and [Node.js][node] (Linux only).

[build-tools]: https://github.com/codeforamerica/howto/blob/master/Build-Tools.md
[ruby]: https://github.com/codeforamerica/howto/blob/master/Ruby.md
[postgres]: https://github.com/codeforamerica/howto/blob/master/PostgreSQL.md
[node]: https://github.com/codeforamerica/howto/blob/master/Node.js.md

### PostgreSQL Accounts

On Linux, PostgreSQL authentication can be [set to _Trust_](http://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.1/static/auth-methods.html#AUTH-TRUST) [in `pg_hba.conf`](https://wiki.postgresql.org/wiki/Client_Authentication) for ease of installation. Create a user that can create new databases, whose name matches the logged-in user account:

    $ sudo -u postgres createuser --createdb --no-superuser --no-createrole `whoami`

On Mac with Postgres.app, this setup is provided by default.

## Install Ohana API

### Fork and clone

[Fork this repository to your GitHub account][fork].

Clone it on your computer and navigate to the project's directory:

    git clone https://github.com/<your GitHub username>/ohana-api.git && cd ohana-api

[fork]: http://help.github.com/fork-a-repo/

### Install the dependencies and populate the database with sample data:

    script/bootstrap

_Note: Installation and preparation can take several minutes to complete!_

### Set up the environment variables & customizable settings

#### Configure environment variables
Inside the `config` folder, you will find a file named `application.example.yml`.
Copy its contents to a new file called `application.yml`, and read through the documentation.

#### Adjust customizable settings
_This step is only necessary if you are planning on customizing the app with_
_the intent of deploying it. If you just want to submit a pull request, you can_
_use the default `settings.yml`._

Inside the `config` folder, you will also find a file called `settings.yml`.
In that file, there are many settings you can, and should, customize.
Read through the documentation to learn how you can customize the app to suit
your needs.

### Run the app

Start the app locally on port 8080:

    rails s -p 8080

### Verify the app is returning JSON

[http://localhost:8080/api/locations](http://localhost:8080/api/locations)

[http://localhost:8080/api/search?keyword=food](http://localhost:8080/api/search?keyword=food)

We recommend the [JSONView][jsonview] Google Chrome extension for formatting
the JSON response so it is easier to read in the browser.

[jsonview]: https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/jsonview/chklaanhfefbnpoihckbnefhakgolnmc

### Uploading and validating your own data

- [Prepare your data][prepare] in a format compatible with Ohana API.

- Place your JSON file in the `data` folder.

- Open `lib/tasks/setup_db.rake`, and replace `sample_data.json` on line 9
with your JSON file.

- Run `script/reset` from the command line.

If the script fails because of `Geocoder::OverQueryLimitError`, try increasing
the sleep value on line 34 in `setup_db.rake `. Alternatively,
use a different geocoding service that allows more requests per second.
See the [geocoding configuration][geocode] section in the Wiki for more details.

If any locations contain invalid data, the script will output the following line:
```
Some locations failed to load. Check data/invalid_records.json.
```
Check `data/invalid_records.json` to see which fields need to be fixed.
Each line will identify the location by its name and will specify the invalid
fields. For example:
```
{"Redwood City Free Medical Clinic":{"errors":{"contacts.name":["can't be blank for Contact"]}}}
```
At this point, your local database is populated with all of the locations from your
JSON file, except for the invalid ones. Therefore, to avoid populating the database
and geocoding the addresses all over again, follow these steps:

1. For each location in `invalid_records.json`, find the corresponding location
in your original JSON file, then copy and paste that location (from your
original JSON file, not `invalid_records.json`) into a new `.json` file.

2. Fix the invalid data in this new file.

3. Set this new file on line 9 of `setup_db.rake`.

4. Delete `invalid_records.json`. The script appends to it, so you want to
delete it before running the script to start fresh each time.

5. Run `bin/rake load_data`

6. If the script outputs `Some locations failed to load.`, repeat steps 1 - 5
until your data is clean.

### Export the database

Once your data is clean, it's a good idea to save a copy of it to make it easy
and much faster to import, whether on your local machine, or on Heroku.
Run this command to export the database:

```
script/export
```
This will create a filed called `ohana_api_development.dump` in the data folder.

### Import the database locally

To reset your local database and populate it again with your clean data:
```
script/import
```

### User and Admin authentication (for the developer portal and admin interface)

The app automatically sets up users and admins you can sign in with.
Their username and password are stored in [db/seeds.rb][seeds].

[seeds]: https://github.com/codeforamerica/ohana-api/blob/master/db/seeds.rb

To set an admin as a Super Admin:

    psql ohana_api_development
    UPDATE "admins" SET super_admin = true WHERE id = 3;
    \q

To access the admin interface, visit [http://localhost:8080/admin/](http://localhost:8080/admin/).
