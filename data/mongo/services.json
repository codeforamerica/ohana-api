(Paternity must be established before child and medical support can be ordered by the court.)  If a court order for child support does not already exist, and the noncustodial parent is located, one will be sought by the SMC/DCSS and established by the court based on both parents' ability to pay support, the amount of time the child spends with each parent, and the financial needs of the child. The SMC/DCSS will also request that the court require the noncustodial parent to provide health insurance if it is available at a reasonable cost. The SMC/DCSS will take steps to enforce court orders for child support and medical support. Enforcement action will be taken by the SMC/DCSS if the noncustodial parent does not pay or pays less than the amount ordered, or if the noncustodial parent does not provide health insurance for the child as ordered by the court. The SMC/DCSS will determine what type of enforcement actions is to be taken, consistent with state and federal regulations. Support payments are accepted online at the Web site: www.casdu.com.
