Acquisition of independent living and life skills is a primary goal for all FHAR consumers.         FHAR's residential continuum includes eight licensed adult residential facilities.

The Adult Day Program is a pre-vocational program for 42 consumers who have behavioral/emotional challenges that prevent their successful participation within standard vocational programs. The purpose of this program is to prepare the participants with the necessary skills to use existing community services and to move from this highly structured community day treatment program to a less restrictive one. The Employment Support Services program is a community-based day program for 60 consumers. It emphasizes independent living skills acquisition, vocational skills acquisition and employment opportunities or volunteer experiences with non-disabled peers.

Individual, group and family counseling is provided to assist with family reunification and to change inappropriate and destructive behavior of youth. Quetzal House, a residential program for adolescent girls, in partnership with the Children's Shelter of Santa Clara County, provides specific services to adolescent girls who are dependents of the court and who exhibit chronic runaway behavior.

The property tax postponement law allows qualified senior, blind or disabled homeowners to have the state pay all or part of their property taxes. Once the state pays the property taxes, a lien is placed against the home. Interest will be charged at the rate established until those taxes are repaid to the state (2% simple interest for 2004/2005 taxes). Payment of the lien and interest is due only if the claimant moves from or sells the home, dies and does not have a spouse who continues to reside in the home, or allows future property taxes to become delinquent. Owners have the option to pay all or part of the lien at any time.   Major eligibility requirements for the postponement program are: (1) all owners (except spouse and direct-line relatives) must be either age 62 or over or be blind or disabled at time of application. (2) All owners (except spouse and direct-line relatives) must have lived in the home as of December 31 of the previous year. If there is more than one qualified claimant living in the home, only one claim may be filed each year. If qualified, a claimant may file for both the property tax postponement program and the homeowner assistance program offered by the FTB. Homeowner assistance claims may be requested from the Franchise Tax Board at 800-338-0505. A claim for postponement may be filed beginning May 15 of the calendar year that precedes the fiscal year tax bill. The filling period ends on December 10 of the fiscal year. A claimant must file a new claim each year. Postponement is also available to qualified persons who reside in and own shares in a cooperative housing corporation, reside on possessory interest property, mobile homes situated on rented or leased land and floating homes.","emails":["postponement@sco.ca.gov"],"faxes_attributes":[{"number":"916 327-3921"}],"hours":"Monday-Friday, 8-5","kind":"government","languages":["Spanish"],"mail_address_attributes":{"_id":{"$oid":"521d331b1974fcdb2b0019dc"},"attention":"Property Tax Postponement","street":"P.O.

Parents who receive public assistance, including Medi-Cal, will automatically be referred to the San Mateo County Department of Child Support Services (SMC/DCSS) by the County of San Mateo Human Services Agency. If paternity (fatherhood) has not yet been established, the SMC/DCSS will take the necessary steps to establish paternity. (Paternity must be established before child and medical support can be ordered by the court.)  If a court order for child support does not already exist, and the noncustodial parent is located, one will be sought by the SMC/DCSS and established by the court based on both parents' ability to pay support, the amount of time the child spends with each parent, and the financial needs of the child. The SMC/DCSS will also request that the court require the noncustodial parent to provide health insurance if it is available at a reasonable cost. The SMC/DCSS will take steps to enforce court orders for child support and medical support. Enforcement action will be taken by the SMC/DCSS if the noncustodial parent does not pay or pays less than the amount ordered, or if the noncustodial parent does not provide health insurance for the child as ordered by the court. The SMC/DCSS will determine what type of enforcement actions is to be taken, consistent with state and federal regulations. Support payments are accepted online at the Web site: www.casdu.com.

Adult Protective Services is a function of Centralized Intake. The TIES Line, a 24-hour toll-free telephone line, receives reports of suspected dependent adult and older adult abuse and neglect. The Centralized Intake Unit, which consists of a multi-disciplinary staff of social workers, public health nurses and deputy public guardians, conducts comprehensive assessments of the client and the allegations, provides information and referral, access and advocacy to county-operated and/or community-based programs as part of the service plan that is developed. Centralized Intake has a 24-Hour Response Program. A social worker receives telephone calls from the community, assesses the client-related matter over the telephone, makes a home visit if appropriate, and may provide short-term emergency protection such as shelter, food, or protective supervision until a long-term plan is developed by an assigned case manager. The Centralized Intake's Representative Payee Program serves individuals who are not conserved, but who need assistance in managing their public benefits.
