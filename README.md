#Ohana API

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/codeforamerica/ohana-api.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/codeforamerica/ohana-api) [![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/codeforamerica/ohana-api/badge.png?branch=master)](https://coveralls.io/r/codeforamerica/ohana-api) [![Dependency Status](https://gemnasium.com/codeforamerica/ohana-api.png)](https://gemnasium.com/codeforamerica/ohana-api)

This is the API portion of the [Ohana API](http://ohanapi.org) project, an open source community resource directory developed by Code for America's 2013 San Mateo County fellowship team. The goal of the project is to make it easier for residents in need to find services they are eligible for.

Apart from Google, the current search interface that residents and social workers have access to is the Peninsula Library System's [CIP portal](http://http://catalog.plsinfo.org:81/). We are developing a [better search interface](http://ohana.herokuapp.com) ([repo link](https://github.com/codeforamerica/human_services_finder)) that consumes the Ohana API.

The master branch currently only uses one model: Organization. We are remodeling our data in the [data-merge](https://github.com/codeforamerica/ohana-api/tree/data-merge) branch to support a structure where an Organization has many Programs in many Locations. The data-merge branch also has an admin interface that allows users to update an organization's data, such as adding a new program or location.

## Installation
Please note that the instructions below have only been tested on OS X. If you are running another operating system and run into any issues, feel free to update this README, or open an issue if you are unable to resolve installation issues.

###Prerequisites

#### Git, Ruby 2.0.0+, Rails 3.2.13+ (+ Homebrew on OS X)
**OS X**: [Set up a dev environment on OS X with Homebrew, Git, RVM, Ruby, and Rails](http://www.moncefbelyamani.com/how-to-install-xcode-homebrew-git-rvm-ruby-on-mac/)

**Windows**: Try [RailsInstaller](http://railsinstaller.org), along with some of these [tutorials](https://www.google.com/search?q=install+rails+on+windows) if you get stuck.


#### MongoDB
**OS X**

On OS X, the easiest way to install MongoDB (or almost any development tool) is with Homebrew:

    brew update
    brew install mongodb

Follow the Homebrew instructions for configuring MongoDB and starting it automatically every time you restart your computer. Otherwise, you can launch MongoDB manually in a separate Terminal tab or window with this command:

    mongod

**Other**

See the Downloads page on mongodb.org for steps to install on other systems: [http://www.mongodb.org/downloads](http://www.mongodb.org/downloads)


#### Redis
**OS X**

On OS X, the easiest way to install Redis is with Homebrew:

    brew install redis

Follow the Homebrew instructions if you want Redis to start automatically every time you restart your computer. Otherwise launch Redis manually in a separate Terminal tab or window:

    redis-server

**Other**

See the Download page on Redis.io for steps to install on other systems: [http://redis.io/download](http://redis.io/download)

#### ElasticSearch
**OS X**

On OS X, the easiest way to install ElasticSearch is with Homebrew:

    brew install elasticsearch

Follow the Homebrew instructions to launch ElasticSearch.

**Other**

Visit the Download page on elasticsearch.org for steps to install on other systems: [http://www.elasticsearch.org/download/](http://www.elasticsearch.org/download/)

### Clone the app on your local machine:

    git clone git://github.com/codeforamerica/ohana-api.git
    cd ohana-api

### Install the dependencies:

    bundle

### Load the data
You can load a dataset of community-based organizations in San Mateo County in your local db with this command:

    rake load_data

Create the geospatial indexes for the [geocoder](https://github.com/alexreisner/geocoder) gem:

    rake db:mongoid:create_indexes

Generate the ElasticSearch index that the [tire](https://github.com/karmi/tire) gem uses for full text search:

    rake environment tire:import CLASS=Organization FORCE=true

### Run the app
Start the app locally using Unicorn:

    unicorn

### Verify the app is returning JSON
To see all organizations, 30 per page:

    http://localhost:8080/api/organizations

To go the next page (the page parameter works for all API responses):

    http://localhost:8080/api/organizations&page=2

Search for organizations by keyword and/or location:

    http://localhost:8080/api/search?keyword=food
    http://localhost:8080/api/search?keyword=childcare&location=94403
    http://localhost:8080/api/search?keyword=food&location=san mateo
    http://localhost:8080/api/search?location=redwood city, ca

Search for organizations by languages spoken at the location:

    http://localhost:8080/api/search?keyword=food&language=spanish

The language parameter can be used alone:

    http://localhost:8080/api/search?language=arabic

Searches with the location parameter return results sorted by distance. Searches with the keyword parameter return results sorted by relevance based on a match between the search term and the organization's `keywords` field.

We recommend these tools to interact with APIs:

[JSONView](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/jsonview/chklaanhfefbnpoihckbnefhakgolnmc) Chrome extension

[HTTPie](https://github.com/jkbr/httpie) command line utility

### API documentation
[http://docs.ohanapi.apiary.io/](http://docs.ohanapi.apiary.io/)

The API structure is still in flux, so documentation is a work in progress. We experimented with Apiary, but found it didn't suit our needs, so we will be probably moving to a custom static site.

### User authentication and emails
The app allows developers to sign up for an account via the home page (http://localhost:8080), but all email addresses need to be verified first. In development, the app sends email via Gmail. If you want to try this email process on your local machine, you need to configure your Gmail username and password by creating a file called `application.yml` in the config folder, and entering your info like so:

    GMAIL_USERNAME: your_email@gmail.com
    GMAIL_PASSWORD: your_password

`application.yml` is ignored in `.gitignore`, so you don't have to worry about exposing your credentials if you ever push code to GitHub. If you don't care about email interactions, but still want to try out the signed in experience, you can load 2 example users in the database with this command:

    rake db:seed

You can then [sign in](http://localhost:8080/users/sign_in) with either of those users, whose username and password are stored in [db/seeds.rb](https://github.com/codeforamerica/ohana-api/blob/master/db/seeds.rb).

### Test the app
To test locally, you will need to run this once to set up the test DB:

    rake db:mongoid:create_indexes RAILS_ENV=test

Then you can run tests with this simple command:

    rspec

For faster tests:

    gem install zeus
    zeus start #in a separate Terminal window or tab
    zeus rspec spec

To see the actual tests, browse through the [spec](https://github.com/codeforamerica/ohana-api/tree/master/spec) directory.

## Submitting an Issue
We use the [GitHub issue tracker](https://github.com/codeforamerica/ohana-api/issues) to track bugs and features. Before submitting a bug report or feature request, check to make sure it hasn't already been submitted. When submitting a bug report, please include a [Gist](https://gist.github.com/) that includes a stack trace and any details that may be necessary to reproduce the bug, including your gem version, Ruby version, and operating system. Ideally, a bug report should include a pull request with failing specs.

## Submitting a Pull Request
1. [Fork the repository.][fork]
2. [Create a topic branch.][branch]
3. Add specs for your unimplemented feature or bug fix.
4. Run `rspec`. If your specs pass, return to step 3. In the spirit of Test-Driven Development, you want to write a failing test first, then implement the feature or bug fix to make the test pass.
5. Implement your feature or bug fix.
6. Run `rspec`. If your specs fail, return to step 5.
7. Run `metric_fu -r`. This will go through all the files in the app and analyze the code quality and check for things like trailing whitespaces and hard tabs. When it's done, it will open a page in your browser with the results. Click on `Cane` and `Rails Best Practices` to check for files containing trailing whitespaces and hard tabs. If you use Sublime Text 2, you can use the [TrailingSpaces](https://github.com/SublimeText/TrailingSpaces) plugin to highlight the trailing whitespaces and delete them. If the report complains about "hard tabs" in a file, change your indentation to `spaces` by clicking on `Tabs: 2` at the bottom of your Sublime Text 2 window, then selecting `Convert Indentation to Spaces`. As for the code itself, we try to follow [GitHub's Ruby styleguide](https://github.com/styleguide/ruby).
8. Add, commit, and push your changes.
