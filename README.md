Ohana API is a Ruby on Rails application that makes it easy for communities to publish and maintain a database of social services, and allows developers to build impactful applications that serve underprivileged residents.

This is the API + Admin Interface portion of the [Ohana API](http://ohanapi.org) project, developed by [@monfresh](https://github.com/monfresh), [@spara](https://github.com/spara), and [@anselmbradford](https://github.com/anselmbradford) during their Code for America Fellowship in 2013, in partnership with San Mateo County's Human Services Agency.

The Ohana project also comes with a [web-based search interface](https://github.com/codeforamerica/ohana-web-search) that allows anyone to easily find services that are available in a particular community.

## Development Road Map for 2014
As a winner of the Knight News Challenge (Health edition), the Ohana project received a [grant from the Knight Foundation](http://www.knightfoundation.org/grants/201447979/), which allowed us to improve the project, and prepare it for broader installation by a variety of organizations and governments.

We've fulfilled most of the deliverables defined in our agreement with the Knight Foundation, which ends in January 2015. Our remaining tasks are listed in the [Issues](https://github.com/codeforamerica/ohana-api/issues) section of this repo.

Please note that between now and January 2015, there could be breaking changes in the API as we update it to support the [OpenReferral spec](https://github.com/codeforamerica/OpenReferral). The spec is currently at version 0.2, and version 1.0 is scheduled to be released in early January 2015.

## Stack Overview

* Ruby version 2.1.3
* Rails version 4.1.8
* Postgres
* Testing Frameworks: RSpec, Factory Girl, Capybara

## Demo
You can see a running version of the different parts of the application here:

**Developer portal**: [http://ohana-api-demo.herokuapp.com/](http://ohana-api-demo.herokuapp.com/)
(see [db/seeds.rb][developer_portal_seeds] for two usernames and passwords you can sign in with).

**API**: [http://ohana-api-demo.herokuapp.com/api](http://ohana-api-demo.herokuapp.com/api)

**Admin Interface**: [http://ohana-api-demo.herokuapp.com/admin](http://ohana-api-demo.herokuapp.com/admin)
(see [db/seeds.rb][admin_interface_seeds] for three usernames and passwords you can sign in with).

[admin_interface_seeds]: https://github.com/codeforamerica/ohana-api/blob/master/db/seeds.rb#L25-45

## Data Schema
If you would like to try out the current version of the project, please read the Wiki article about [Populating the Postgres DB from a JSON file](https://github.com/codeforamerica/ohana-api/wiki/Populating-the-Postgres-database-from-a-JSON-file). That article documents the current schema and data dictionary, but please note that this will be in flux as we are working with various interested parties to define a [Human Services Data Specification](https://github.com/codeforamerica/OpenReferral).

## API documentation (work in progress)
[http://codeforamerica.github.io/ohana-api-docs/](http://codeforamerica.github.io/ohana-api-docs/)

As the API is updated to match the [OpenReferral specification](https://github.com/codeforamerica/OpenReferral), the
documentation will be updated as well. Version 1.0 of the spec is scheduled
to be released in early January 2015.

## Client libraries

- Ruby: [Ohanakapa][ohanakapa] (our official wrapper)

We would love to see libraries for other programming languages.
If you've built one, let us know and we'll add it here.

## Taxonomy
By default, this project uses the [Open Eligibility](http://openeligibility.org) taxonomy to assign Services to [Categories](https://github.com/codeforamerica/ohana-api/blob/master/app/models/category.rb).
If you would like to use your own taxonomy, feel free to update this rake task to [create your own hierarchy or tree structure](https://github.com/codeforamerica/ohana-api/blob/master/lib/tasks/oe.rake). Then run `rake create_categories`.

The easiest way to assign categories to a service is to use the Admin interface. Here's a screenshot:
