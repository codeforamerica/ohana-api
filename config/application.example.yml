# First, copy the contents of this file to a new file called "application.yml"
# in the same "config" directory.

# This file is used by the "figaro" gem to allow you to store and use
# environment variables in the app without having to set them via the
# command line each time you run the app in development. Another advantage
# is that you can make changes in a production environment (such as Heroku)
# by simply changing the value of the environment variable, as opposed to
# making code changes and having to push them to apply the new setting.
# Read more about figaro here: https://github.com/laserlemon/figaro

# Note that changes to this file require a server restart to take effect.

# Each entry sets a local environment variable and overrides ENV variables
# in the Unix shell. For example, setting API_PATH: api makes "api" available
# as ENV['API_PATH'] in the app. See app/config/routes.rb for a usage example.

# If you'd like to run the API on its own subdomain, set API_SUBDOMAIN to your
# desired subdomain name. We recommend "api". Then make sure to delete "api"
# from "API_PATH". That way, you'll have a URL like http://api.yourdomain.org
# instead of http://api.yourdomain.org/api.
#
# Note that an API subdomain won't work on Heroku unless you're using a custom
# domain name. Heroku doesn't support sub-subdomains when using their default
# setup, which gives you a URL such as http://ohana-api-demo.herokuapp.com.
# In development, you can test it by adding the subdomain to 'lvh.me:8080'.
# For example: http://api.lvh.me:8080.
API_SUBDOMAIN:

# The API_PATH setting is related to the API_SUBDOMAIN setting. If you're not
# using a separate subdomain for the API, then define the path for the API,
# which is set to "api" by default. If you do decide to use an API_SUBDOMAIN,
# make sure to set API_PATH to blank.
API_PATH: api

# If you'd like to run the admin interface on its own subdomain, set
# ADMIN_SUBDOMAIN to your desired subdomain name. We recommend "admin".
# Then make sure to delete "admin" from "ADMIN_PATH". That way, you'll have a
# URL like http://admin.example.org instead of http://admin.example.org/admin.
#
# Note that an ADMIN subdomain won't work on Heroku unless you're using a custom
# domain name. Heroku doesn't support sub-subdomains when using their default
# setup, which gives you a URL such as http://ohana-api-demo.herokuapp.com.
# In development, you can test it by adding the subdomain to 'lvh.me:8080'.
# For example: http://admin.lvh.me:8080.
ADMIN_SUBDOMAIN:

# The ADMIN_PATH setting is related to the ADMIN_SUBDOMAIN setting. If you're
# not using a separate subdomain for the admin interface, then define its path,
# which is set to "admin" by default. If you do decide to use an ADMIN_SUBDOMAIN,
# make sure to set ADMIN_PATH to blank.
ADMIN_PATH: admin

# If you'd like to run the developer portal on its own subdomain,
# set DEV_SUBDOMAIN to your desired subdomain name, such as "developer".
#
# Note that the DEV_SUBDOMAIN won't work on Heroku unless you're using a custom
# domain name. Heroku doesn't support sub-subdomains when using their default
# setup, which gives you a URL such as http://ohana-api-demo.herokuapp.com.
# In development, you can test it by adding the subdomain to 'lvh.me:8080'.
# For example: http://developer.lvh.me:8080.
DEV_SUBDOMAIN:

# This setting controls how many results you want to the API to return
# per page by default. Note that clients can set this dynamically via
# the "per_page" parameter, but if "per_page" is not specified, then the
# setting below will dictate how many results are returned.
DEFAULT_PER_PAGE: 30

# This setting controls the maximum amount of results you want to the API to
# return per page. If a client sets the "per_page" parameter to a value higher
# than MAX_PER_PAGE, the API will limit results per page to MAX_PER_PAGE.
MAX_PER_PAGE: 50

# The value of ADMIN_APP_TOKEN here should match the value of
# OHANA_API_TOKEN in the Admin app:
# https://github.com/codeforamerica/ohana-api-admin
# In production, you should set this token to a long random string
# that you can generate from the command line with "rake secret".
ADMIN_APP_TOKEN: changeme
