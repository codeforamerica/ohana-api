# This file is used by the "figaro" gem to allow you to store and use
# environment variables in the app without having to set them via the
# command line each time you run the app in development.

# Read more about figaro here: https://github.com/laserlemon/figaro

# First, copy the contents of this file to a new file called "application.yml"
# in the same "config" directory.

# Each entry sets a local environment variable and overrides ENV variables
# in the Unix shell. For example, setting:
# API_BASE_URL: http://ohana-api-demo.herokuapp.com/api
# makes "http://ohana-api-demo.herokuapp.com/api" available as
# ENV["API_BASE_URL"] in the app. See app/api/ohana.rb
# for a usage example.

# Add application configuration variables here, as shown below.

# If you're running the app on a different port on your development
# machine, change the port values below to match your port.
API_BASE_URL: http://localhost:8080/api/
API_BASE_HOST: http://localhost:8080/

# The value of ADMIN_APP_TOKEN here should match the value of
# OHANA_API_TOKEN in the Admin app:
# https://github.com/codeforamerica/ohana-api-admin
# In production, you should set this token to a long random string
# that you can generate from the command line with "rake secret".
ADMIN_APP_TOKEN: changeme
