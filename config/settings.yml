# GEOGRAPHICAL BOUNDS SETTINGS
#
###############################
#
# Google provides a "bounds" option to restrict the address search to
# a particular area. This allows Google to disambiguate between two
# cities with the same name. For example, there is a city in San Mateo
# County called 'Brisbane'. There also happens to be a 'Brisbane' in
# Australia. If you didn't restrict the search to within San Mateo County,
# and you searched for locations near 'Brisbane', Google would look in
# Australia by default, and you wouldn't get any results.
#
# The bounds are defined by the SW and NE geo coordinates of your search area.
# It should be an array of two arrays. The first array should represent the
# SW coordinates, and the second the NE coordinates. Within each inner array,
# the coordinates should be Floats in [latitude, longitude] order. For example:
# bounds: [[37.1074, -122.521], [37.7084, -122.085]]
#
# The app is set to search within the continental US by default.
# Make sure to change the coordinates to match your preferred search area.
#
# This setting is used in 'app/models/concerns/search.rb'.
bounds: [[25.7084, -124.085], [48.9084, -67.085]]

#
# SETTINGS FOR ADMIN INTERFACE
#
###############################
#
# An array of email domain names used by the admin interface to determine which
# users get to access which locations. For convenience, the API allows a client
# to retrieve locations that match a particular domain name. This means that
# when someone signs in to the admin interface with an organization email
# address, like "moncef@codeforamerica.org", then they will have access to all
# locations that match "codeforamerica.org". This works for these types of
# organization domain names, but if we allowed the same lookup for people with
# generic email addresses that end in "@gmail.com" for example, then they would
# be able to access all locations with "gmail.com" in the "emails" field.
# To prevent that, the API compares the domain name with the list of generic
# domains that you define below, and if it finds it, then it looks for an exact
# match of the full email address.
#
# Depending on the email addresses present in your data, you might need to add
# domains to the list below. For example, in San Mateo County, many employees
# have a generic "@smcgov.org" email, even though they work in different
# departments, and should only be able to access their specific locations.
#
# This setting is used in 'app/models/concerns/search.rb'.
generic_domains:
  - gmail.com
  - aol.com
  - sbcglobal.net
  - hotmail.com
  - yahoo.com
  - comcast.net

# The email address that admin interface users should send questions/issues to.
# This link appears when an admin views their locations and organizations.
# See app/views/admin/locations/index.html.haml and
# app/views/admin/organizations/index.html.haml.

#
# SERVICE AREAS SETTINGS
#
#########################
#
# If your data contains a service_areas field that identifies which particular
# areas of a city or county are eligible for the services provided by an
# organization, and if you want to make sure that the service areas are always
# spelled the same way, then enter them below, one per line preceded by a dash
# and a space, just like the generic_domains above. Make sure to preserve the
# 2-space indentation. For example:
# valid_service_areas:
#   - Alameda County
#   - Oakland
#
# This setting is used in 'app/models/service.rb'.
valid_service_areas:

############################
#
# HEROKU SUBDOMAIN SETTINGS
#
############################
#
# When using the default Heroku setup (http://app-name.herokuapp.com),
# set this to "2". Once you're ready to deploy to production, you will
# most likely want to set up a custom domain name, like "smc-connect.org".
# Once you do that, you will need to set the tld_length to the number
# of dots in your top-level domain name, which will most likely be "1", but
# if you are using ".co.uk" for example, then you should set it to "2".
#
# This setting is used in config/environments/production.rb.
tld_length: 2
